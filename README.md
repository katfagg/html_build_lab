# Building My Own Website - Looking After Houseplants

My inspiration for this website came from spending my weekend nurturing my own houseplants; lots of googling how to best look after them (again! Always good to remind yourself!). The Gardenista website is gorgeous in my opinion (https://www.gardenista.com/garden-design-101/succulents-and-cacti/aloe/) and enticed me to follow this topic.

1. A sleek header
2. A block where the user can sign up to the newsletter, accompanied by a picture of some very healthy plants
3. A list of product cards with key information for the most popular houseplants
4. A footer with social media handles clear to the user
